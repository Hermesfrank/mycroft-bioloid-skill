This code is to allow adding voice-directed command skill for my Robotis Bioloid robot using a Mycroft front end.

If you clone this to use, be sure to uncomment the requirements.txt file at least initially so the dependencies will load to your machine. Once done, the remove/install skill process goes much faster when they are commented out.
